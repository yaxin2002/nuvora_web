Nuvora site quickstart (for Vercel drag & drop)
1) Vercel → New Project → "Deploy without Git" → drag this folder.
2) If asked, Framework = Other, Build Command = (empty), Output Directory = (empty or ".").
3) After deploy, rename the project to a nice slug (e.g., "nuvora-health" or "nuvora-yx") to get SLUG.vercel.app.
Tip: Make your QR point to https://SLUG.vercel.app/go — later you can change where /go redirects without reprinting cards.
